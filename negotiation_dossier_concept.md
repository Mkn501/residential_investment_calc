# Concept: Data-Driven Negotiation Dossier
*Automated strictly from App Inputs (Price, Rent, Interest).*

## Structure

### Page 1: The "Financial Reality Check"
**Goal**: Show that the current numbers don't add up for an investor.

1.  **Header**: Investment Evaluation
2.  **Key Metrics (Status Quo)**:
    *   Asking Price: **[469.000 €]**
    *   Net Yield: **[1.92 %]** (Calculated)
    *   First Month Cashflow: **[-475 €]** (Calculated)
3.  **The "Yield Gap" (Chart)**:
    *   Bar Chart: Property Yield (1.9%) vs. Risk-Free Bond (3.8%) vs. Mortgage Rate (3.8%).
    *   *Narrative*: "The property currently yields less than a risk-free government bond and significantly less than the cost of debt (Negative Leverage)."

### Page 2: The "Fair Price" Derivation
**Goal**: Mathematically derive the offer price.

1.  **Valuation Logic**:
    *   "To achieve a sustainable market yield of **3.5%** (Standard for this location/condition):"
2.  **The Calculation**:
    *   Target Net Income: **[X €]** (Rent - Costs)
    *   Required All-in Investment: **[Y €]** (Income / 3.5%)
    *   Less Closing Costs (Makler/Tax/Notary): **[- Z €]**
    *   **= Maximum Purchase Price: [375.000 €]**
    
### Page 3: The Binding Offer
**Goal**: A formal document to sign.

*   **Offer Letter**:
    *   "Based on the financial analysis and the current interest rate environment of [3.8%], a purchase price of [469.000 €] is not economically viable."
    *   "We are prepared to offer **[375.000 €]**."
    *   *Subject to final technical due diligence.*

This approach requires NO new inputs. It simply re-packages the existing math (Yield, Interest, Cashflow) into an aggressive argument.
